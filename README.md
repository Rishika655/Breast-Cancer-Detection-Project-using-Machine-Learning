## 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection with Logistic Regression

#### A Machine Learning project to predict whether a breast tumor is Malignant (cancerous) or Benign (non-cancerous) using Logistic Regression

Cancer is scary.
Early detection saves lives.
So I built this.

This repo is about using Logistic Regression to predict if a breast tumor is Malignant or Benign.
Simple model. Important problem.

## 📖 Why this project?

I wanted to see how a basic ML model can do on a real medical dataset.
Turns out… pretty good.
Around 96% accuracy on test data.
Not bad for a few lines of Python.

## ✨ What it does

Takes medical diagnostic features (radius, texture, perimeter… 30 in total).

Learns patterns from historical tumor data.

Predicts whether the tumor is cancerous or not.

Can even take your custom input and give you instant prediction.

## ⚙️ How to run it

##### Clone the repo. Install the stuff. Run the file.

https://github.com/Rishika655/Breast-Cancer-Detection-Project-using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Classification_Using_Machine_Learning.ipynb

Want to test on your own input? Change the input_data in predict.py.
Run it.
It will tell you:

Malignant. or Benign.

Short. Direct.

## 📊 Dataset in short

It’s the Breast Cancer Diagnosis Dataset (comes with scikit-learn).For data, data.csv is attached.

569 samples.

30 features.

##### Labels:

0 → Malignant

1 → Benign

## 📈 Results

The Logistic Regression model does solid.
Around 96% accuracy.
Not state of the art. But hey, pretty reliable for a simple model.

## 🔮 What’s next?

Maybe compare with SVM.
Or throw in a Random Forest.
Or make a small web app with Streamlit.
Plenty of ideas.

## 🤝 Contribute?

Sure, why not.
Fork. PR. Suggest cool stuff.
I’ll take a look.
